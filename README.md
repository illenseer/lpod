# Tools for solving Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD)

## metalpod
`metalpod` is a meta-programming and saturation based approach to solve
Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions. It is based on
[`metasp`](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/labs.html#metasp).

## traod aka TRAnslate Ordered Disjunctions
`traod` is a parser for Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions and translates
them into logic programs, which can be handled by `metalpod` or
[`asprin`](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/labs.html#asprin).
