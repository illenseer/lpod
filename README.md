# Tools for solving Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD)

## metalpod
`metalpod` contains logic programs derived from
[metasp](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/labs.html#metasp) to solve Logic
Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD). It uses meta-programming and a
saturation based approach.

## traod aka TRAnslate Ordered Disjunctions
`traod` contains a parser for LPODs and translates them to instances which can
be handled by `metalpod` or
[`asprin`](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/labs.html#asprin).
